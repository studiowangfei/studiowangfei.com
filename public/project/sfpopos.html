I researched, designed and built everything you see here. Big thanks to all open-source data and real-time map APIs. The structured Geo JSON data that I created can be found at <a id="shengmin" href="https://github.com/studiowangfei/SanFrancisco_POPOS">GitHub</a>. </p><p>It's still under development... Stay tuned! </p></div> <div class="feature_regular"> <img src="../img/project/sfpopos/sfpopos_cover.jpg"> </div> <div class="feature_title"> Context </div> <div class="feature_descript"> POPOS stands for Privately Owned Public Open Space. POPOS are publicly accessible spaces in forms of plazas, terraces, atriums, small parks, and even snippets that are provided and maintained by private property owners. In San Francisco, POPOS mostly appear in the Downtown office district area. Private developers provide POPOS under three general circumstances: voluntarily, in exchange for a density bonus, or as a condition of approval. </div> <div class="feature_regular"> <img src="../img/project/sfpopos/sfpopos_bay_1.jpg"> <br> <img src="../img/project/sfpopos/sfpopos_bay_2.jpg"> </div> <div class="feature_title"> Design Challenge </div> <div class="feature_descript"> The information and geo-data of San Francisco's POPOS are not well gathered and structured, which means the first step will be creating the database and mapping out all POPOS. Another challenge will be creating clear and easy-to-understand visuals of space's shadow and sunlight conditions, which asks to go beyond 2D representation and bring in 3D visualization. </div> <div class="feature_regular"> <img src="../img/project/sfpopos/sfpopos_map.jpg"> </div> <div class="feature_regular"> <img src="../img/project/sfpopos/sfpopos_flow.jpg"> </div> <div class="feature_title"> 2D to 3D </div> <div class="feature_descript"> Using the City Modeling data of San Francisco and the annual solar data from ESRL, a 2D POPO's shadow map was created as the first step, then moved to a 3D building shadow map. </div> <div class="feature_regular"> <img src="../img/project/sfpopos/sfpopos_2d.jpg"> </div> <div class="feature_regular"> <img src="../img/project/sfpopos/sfpopos_3d.jpg"> </div> <div class="feature_title"> POPOS Finder & Sunshine Teller </div> <div class="feature_descript"> An app is envisioned and designed for general public users to view overall SF POPOS info, locate a specific POPOS, and learn about real-time sunlight/shadow information about it.
