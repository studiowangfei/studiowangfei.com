            Overview
          </div>
          <div class="feature_descript">
            This is a freelancing design for ZOOM Video Technologies.
            <p>I worked as UI/UX Designer on this project.
            I collaborated directly with CEO, UI/UX Lead and front-end engineers on the whole design and development process.
            All wireframes, mockups and visual assets were designed and created by me.
            <br></br>
            <p>The design helped ZOOM establish a clear and well-organized navigating, selecting and paying experience for over 24 kinds of enterprise and consumer products and plans.

            User Problem
          </div>
          <div class="feature_descript">
            Starting from 1 product with 3 plans in 2011, Zoom Video has expanded its product lines to 5 categories, 8 service types and over 24 kinds of free and paid plans. The complexity and variety of all Zoom's plans make it very difficult for users to understand and select the right product and the right plan immediately and effectively. Three problems of the old Zoom's home need to be solved through this new landing-page design:
            <br></br>
            <p class="feature_text_list">1. Unclear and patched product categories and plans
            <p class="feature_text_list">2. Effectively but invisible accesses to certain products
            <p class="feature_text_list">3. Inconsistency and fragmentation of different product pages
          </div>

            Design Goal
          </div>
          <div class="feature_descript">
            To address the existing page's user experience problems, the design goals are divided into three steps:
            <br></br>
            <p class="feature_text_list">1. Establish clear hierarchy of products and plans
            <p class="feature_text_list">2. Establish consistent UI structure and visual design
            <p class="feature_text_list">3. Create visible, effective and clean visual elements

            Product Hierarchy & Site Maps
          </div>
          <div class="feature_descript">
            Before diving into actual design, I firstly organized all of Zoom's products and established a clear hierarchy, which also led to the site maps of landing page.

            Based on the product hierarch, two options were explored for different user interactions and interface layouts.
