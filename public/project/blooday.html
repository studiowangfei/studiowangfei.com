            This is a conceptual design for medical testing.
            <p>I worked as the sole Product Designer and UX Researcher on the whole design process for this project.
            All wireframes, mockups and visual assets were designed and created by me. The final delivery was based on 5-inch Android phone with Android 5.0+ system.

          <div class="feature_descript">
            Technology and mobile are transforming the way we manage our health. Medical test is no longer a daunting, long and hard-to-understand process. Blooday envisions a friendly, instant and approachable experience to receive your blood test result. After you took a blood test as part of a routine check-up, your doctor uses this mobile app to visualize the results and delivers them to you instantly. The design of Blooday addresses two main problems:
            <br></br>
            <p style="font-weight: 500;">1. What functions this app should provide to make blood testing process seamless?
            <p style="font-weight: 500;">2. What types of information of testing result should be shown and how to organize them?

            Design Goal
          </div>
          <div class="feature_descript">
            Overall the design is to clearly and effectively deliver test results, and help user to take further actions. The specific design goals are formulated through two steps. The first is to understand different users' engaging behaviors, and to organize the level of information serving different engagements. The second is to have functions for user to address potential health concerns and medical appointments.

          </div>
          <div class="feature_descript">
            The test result panel is designed to show the information in three levels. The first level is summary and conclusion for very quick reading. The second is to break down the test result into specific items, and to identify the out-of-range item with visual design, which enables user to quickly locate the problem. The third level is to really dive into the out-of-range metric and offer explanation and suggestions for improvement.
