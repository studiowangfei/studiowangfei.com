                  <p class="writing_title">Ten Thousand Clients: San Francisco to Rural China</p>
                  The last decade has witnessed the fall of excess, ownership and authorship on the one hand, and the rise of scarcity, sharing and anonymity on the other. While architecture continues abiding by the rules of the falling system and chasing newer and newer performances in the old play, the confluence of social networking, crowdsourcing and the sharing economy have started subverting the table and writing the new game rules. As a research-oriented exhibition, "Ten Thousand Clients" asks how architecture regains a position within the current digital turn guided by many minds and many hands, and how architects re-calibrates their thinking and doing in a context of post-abundance and after-neophilia. Two emerging spatial models are selected in order to scrutinize the new phenomena: San Francisco's coworking spaces and rural China's Taobao e-commerce villages.
                  <br>Since 2005, San Francisco - the cradle of coworking - has engendered over seventy coworking spaces citywide that accommodate thousands of part-timers, contract workers and freelancers. This web-dependent labor force embraces employment mobility, flexible hours, diverse environments, and spontaneous collaborations. As the social condenser of these coworkers, coworking spaces claim different metrics for programs, amenities, circulation and protocols than traditional cooperative offices.</br>
                  Launched in 2003, the Taobao e-commerce platform has evolved into an alternative path to Chinese urbanization. Instead of swarming into cities for employment, more and more rural residents are choosing to stay in the countryside and become e-commerce entrepreneurs. As the spatial nodes of 1.3 million rural e-traders, more than thirty e-commerce villages have sprung across China yielding a P2P-based industrial chain. The Internet has played an integral role in this shuffle of urbanization and rural revitalization, in turn producing spatial consequences that affect even the basic assumptions of living and working.
                  <br>Rather than seeking distinctions between a post-industrial smart city and a pre-industrial marginalized rural, the exhibition juxtaposes these two cases in order to disclose a common mechanism that are pervading globally. Questions are raised to this crowd-based logic and its attendant effects on architectural discipline and practice: Is it the manifestation of diversity or another round of generic? Is it a new practical utopia and commonism, or merely an augmented version of capitalism and consumerism? How can architecture capture "ten thousand clients" and rehabilitate its social agency? If the author was already dead in an old sea of brick and mortar, what role do architects take in facing this new world of click and mortar?</br><br></br>

                  I
                  <br>This leap is Another Leap.</br>
                  Compared to “Great Leap Forward” implemented by the Communist Party of China in 1958, and “One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind” by Neil Armstrong of Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, Another Leap is a tiny, intensive, and bottom-up leap. It is a series of collective actions based on individual will. It is a direct practice of “two heads are better than one”, an empirical iteration of “1+1>2”. It is a collective leap forwarded by many minds and many hands.
                  <br>Another Leap aims at the lost part of architecture, art and technology and the problems generated by the system. We make attempts to explore the power of globalization and Internet, as well as the possible prospects shaped by this power. Today, the emergence of a new art system is clearly witnessed by us all; it’s a global blueprint with broad and infinite possibilities of proliferation. Those in it are private collectors, star artists, monopolistic galleries, famous auction houses and financial oligarchy; with stop-by private yachts, helicopters and wine parties. However in the meantime, the creativity and destructive force of art, which has been developed since the time of modernism, have never been so submissive to money and capital.
                  As a discipline of 500 years of history, architecture has never been so out of position. If saying that modernism is trying to balance between the Utopia of art and the reality of capitalism, then the architecture of computer instrumentalization is doing the work of mixing: art, technology, consumerism, urbanization, ruralization, crust, pattern, gradient, curve and building energy efficiency are mixed and shown to people. No more their original looks, only capital left. Architecture is now exhausted. At this moment when buildings and architects feel weary but unable to stop, a question invariably exists like a slapping on the face: Which is more difficult? To make a chocolate cake with strawberry fringe in a bakery or to build a smooth, parametrically varied building envelop in an architectural competition?</br>
                  Globalization and Internalization since 1990s provide three theoretical and practical foundations for Another Leap: the popularization of digital devices, the explosion of social network and mobile Internet, and the new paradigm of economy and production. Sharing and crowdsourcing advocated by internet protocol make it possible to liberate oneself from mass production of economy of scale, to contribute individual effort while enjoy collective fruits, and to practice beyond the given identity and discipline.
                  <br>Another Leap is not just an exhibition; more importantly, it’s a sustainable way of practice. With participants including artist, architect, designer and engineer, Another Leap delivers a pragmatic implementation beyond any form of instrumentalism, an interdisciplinary thinking-doing across politics, economy and geography, and an unknown (de-) ideology that leads us forward. It’s a direct and critical response to the technical revolution and instrumental digitization which have been emerged in architecture and art fields since the 1990s. Another Leap manifests itself as a critical response to the instrumental digitization emerged in architecture and art since 1990s.</br>
                  <br>II</br>
                  From the perspective of Internet, it’s of great urgency that we rethink about the term technical revolution and “digital shift” since the 1990s, for it narrows our thinking and practicing to tame instrumentalism. In the field of architecture, the trend of computer-aided design and free form in the recent 20 years has not changed the reality that architects are losing social agency. Twenty years’ study and practice of digitalization left us fragments without grounds, consumed and forgotten. Even till today, there are still questions we are not able to answer: why should architecture be bionic? Why does architecture need algorithm to build? Why does architecture claim to be fluid but turn out to be fixed stuff? Why even modelling and rendering companies begin to design buildings? The efficient productivity results from the instrumentalization of computer technology and the profits brought by urbanization have made it possible for architects to survive longer in the dead sea of material space and image production; however, as what has been indicated in Koolhaas’ allergy of the swimming pool: swimming people are getting farther away from their original direction.
                  <br>In the field of art, digital technology has become a new painting tool; on the paper of Internet, those terrible forms of “computer art”, “code art” and “software art” are still finding their uncertain positions in galleries, museums and collection system. Actually, the classification of art by instrumentalism should have been completed ten years ago. The equality among media has eventually completed since the invention of photography, after hundred years of war (Peter Weibel, Globalization and Contemporary Art, 2013); what follows should be the mixing and crossing of the media. After all, to go beyond instrumentalism is the big leap forward towards a further use of Internet and technical culture into social practice.
                  Different from computer instrumentalism which does not care about positions and social agency, Internet and its ecosystem are remaking the game rules and reshaping ideology. As a fundamental project which integrates hardware, software, operating system and ecosystem, the Internet is providing with a new proposal about space and material. Digital technology and Internet are no longer just tools for production, but a contract based on transparency, openness and trust: information asymmetry has been erased; unevenly distributed resources have been improved; production barrier has been lowered; regulations and procedures have been simplified. With these new contracts, every consumer becomes the producer themselves. Traditionally private or public concepts are suggested to be shared, coproduced and consumed; these changes in production relations and ideologies are calling for response of every participant from architecture, art and technology field.</br>
                  <br> III</br>
                  It’s getting harder and harder to describe the Internet era using inductive and synthesis. It’s a kind of fragmented and infinitely proliferated experience. Such difficulties are the same as that we couldn’t believe in the first place that analysts, journalist, thinkers and deciders’ dividing complicated objects in parts and revealing scientific, economic and social phenomenon respectively (Bruno Latour). What Another Leap needs is a (de)ideology as well as suspending, mixed, and more action-focused anticipation. This requires us to integrate the political, economic, technical and geographical pieces into an overall cultural landscape, using a list with endless possible key words.
                  <br>Non-Subject</br>
                  The emergence of the concept “non-subject” represents a blurred traditional identity, a loosened subject-object structure, as well as our rethinking of the surrounding objects and environment. Those objects we used to control will become equal participants in the future. This is the evolutionary speeding adaptation made by human genes (Marcus Pembrey); a reflection of man-made objects to human shaping (Mark Roeder). We receive the same influence and power from the objects as we exert on them; the line between we and them has blurred. The recently developed information modelling software and Cloud Computing are, to some extent, a reversion of the edging architectural technology based on cybernetics since the 1970s. Similarly, it’s accompanied by the art circle’s new round of attention on mainstream concepts, including their deviation in modern times and the conceptual challenge from media technology. In the first ten years of the 21st century, the popularization of OOP directly results in the development of Object-based political philosophy. This kind of political philosophy advocates the elimination of people’s sensual and experimental perception of objects, returning them to their mixed and pre-modern state. This makes it possible for us to alter the central position of politics, science, art and technology, breaking to boundaries between fields and enlarging the scope of further participation.
                  <br>Self-organization</br>
                  Self-organization is an instant response to capital operation and a practical strategy of protest. A globalized society has been established, new-liberalism is prevailing and capitalism has been more completed than ever. Under the intrusion of money and capital, urbanization has become its frame and architecture its carrier; architects, however, are working day and night to make decorations on it. The capital structure generates new forms while brings new risks as well: as individuals, the risk lies in losing resistance and social agency and lives’ final capturing by the capital (Franco Berardi). Self-organization, as an organizational strategy, is fixing the problems brought by traditional political groups in the declined and fragmented information society. As capital and labor market have become global and networked, political groups united by workers (and nation as their carriers) are losing their basis of globalization. This provides the opportunity for the establishment of new self-organizational groups.
                  <br>Self-organization tends to achieve a common action and a common ground of understanding and trust, forming a community to the greatest extent. The development of Internet provides the most effective material foundation for self-organization: scattered information and Internet connection enable the scope of self-organization to reach its farthest end; commonly shared production tools, low production cost and cooperative operation platform establish a new space for self-organization; the shift from economy of scale to shared economy, however, releases the untapped productivity in traditional industry structure. Self-organization has become a motivation of escaping from the net of capital, producing the possibility of releasing us from the end of production chain.</br>
                  Agency
                  <br>In the age of globalization and capital operation, no position or a fake one is the best position. No position means to be completely obedient to game rules and becomes what Said says a worker of social security and technology. A fake position means that we can still hide in the cliché of idealism, imaging an old useless revolution in the new world. The social agency lost by architects and artists can only gain in the productivity released in society’s transformation period. This social agency is the flaw in power structure and therefore not brought by opposition, protest or rebellion but rather a prepared attack; an alliance, a negotiation and compromise; it’s setting the new rules.</br>
                  In the new world, art is currency; it has the same power as capital. Such power is the extraordinary ability of integrating social elites, complex philosophy, mass discourse and other cultural mixtures in the capital flow around the world. In contemporary culture’s intervention strategy, what we need to do are retrieval, reframing, capturing, reiterating and documenting. The key to these is whether we can make art break the weakest link of production chain rather than make it yield to the capital world. For those architects who are losing or already lost social agency, if they cannot free themselves from the end of production chain, then it’s for sure that architecture cannot make it to the year 2049.
                  <br>Two Spaces</br>
                  The anxiety about the material world being expelled by virtual space in the 1990s is gradually removed by “the Internet of things”; nowadays entity and virtual space coexist with each other. No matter Airbnb or Zipcar, the Internet type of “architecture” and “space” represent a brand new spatial and material strategy based on architecture and city. There is no need to ask whether real space is important or not; instead, it’s what architects should focus on that matters.
                  The anxiety that “real/virtual” space exerts on the world of art is, however, increasing. What we are now facing is a world with 200% growth rate of image uploading; every day we see the exhibitions in New York, London, Berlin and Beijing through mobile phones, computer and iPad. Even within the same city, we’ve already get used to express our artistic opinions facing a HD picture. Our perception of modern art has been increasingly dependent on images; we may even realize that in the future, the needs for images are more realistic than the needs for a gallery. When the desire for image and text becomes strong enough, the world of art will turn into the world of Internet, where the spread and requirement of values are linked by different forms; through compression and packing, audience, space, events and their meanings are hence connected. Museums, galleries and exhibition spaces only exist as sacred places, remaining a smelly corruptive power system after the dischantment by capital. One undeniable fact is that we don’t fully realize the transformation of these two spaces and their consequences. It can be disastrous, even destroying modern art right before our ignorance and contempt.
                  <br></br>IV
                  <br>Another Leap is not an exhibition. In exhibition space, Another Leap is a collection of series events; it shows a plan unable to realize, an idea to be born and grow, a fifth edition of an artwork, an educational space open for public participation, an art document facing reactivation, and a project that can never be finished. It’s the preparation, beginning and middle way on a timeline, only that we cannot call it a finished work; because it’s open to reactivate, discuss, break off and revise.</br>
                  If we regard an exhibition as a prelude of entering the collection system, then Another Leap can be seen as a workshop placed in a museum, only the participants have already cleaned up the desk. Another Leap can happen at any place; it’s a plan initiated by people who have no clear role-definition and being able to live in different types of cultures. It reflects the experience of a hybrid world. This unclear characteristic enables us to find the most common ground among different fields, accumulating surprising, trivial, intense but respectful social agency consisted of millions of individual will.
                  <br>Another Leap is not just another leap.</br>

                  <p class="writing_title">Rural Agency</p>
                  Architecture has always been a form of physical capital, and urbanization is the process of centralizing the physical capitals. With the triumph of city, rural area has long been marginalized by geographical distance, economic hypodynamia, and populational deprivation. Compared to urbanization that advocates for a core-periphery model, digital technology now manifests new possibilities for democracy, equality, and productivity. By breaking information asymmetry, optimizing resource imbalance, and traversing physical distance, online C2C economy is triggering the decentralization of capital through many minds and many hands. Behind this drastically increasing economy, a paradigm shift of production is emerging, in which digital platform is liberating productivity through the power of mass individuals regardless of locations, and transforming every customer into producer simultaneously. Traditional distinction between private and public is challenged by “common” that advocates sharing, producing and consuming collectively.
                  <br>If urbanization is making the decay of rural unavoidable, now it’s time to use digital technology to re-envision a productive rural, which poses the question that how rural architectural development respond to this digital paradigm shift.</br>
                  Last 20 years, along with unprecedented urbanization, capital centralization, and labor migration, Chinese society has witnessed a significant decline of its rural area, where large amounts of young population have left countryside and swarmed into cities in order to be employed. The deterioration of Chinese rural is marked by the incomplete social structure in which most families only have the old and kids left, as well as the barren agricultural economy that does not breed desirable job opportunities.
                  <br>Last 10 years, the rise of digital economy provides an alternative for rural population to make their living. Rather than leaving hometowns and rushing into city for employment, more and more people choose to stay in the countryside and start e-commerce on digital platform such as Taobao , which is now marked by the fact that one of five e-traders is a rural resident.</br>
                  Last 5 years, Chinese government has implemented a developing policy called “Building A New Socialist Countryside” that aims at maintaining the rural population and improving the living quality in the countryside. The development now steps into a stagnation because it only produces homogenized social housing but doesn’t create profitable way of production, which eventually fails to fulfill its goal.
                  <br>As an endeavor to regain the agency and productivity of the rural, the thesis proposes Rural Agency - a new individual-entrepreneur- based commune - for Chinese rural development in the age of digital economy. Rural Agency criticizes two rural developing models: one is the historical institution – “People’s Commune (1958-1978)” – that invented communal architecture based on absolute communism and egalitarianism; the other is the current governmental policy – “Build A New Socialist Countryside (2006-)” – that produces private and homogeneous housing cluster without providing profitable jobs. Instead of implementing either collectivization or privatization, Rural Agency situates between the two. It provides an institutional framework and architectural type that advocates the new living-working mode based on individual entrepreneurship and communal production.</br>
                  As a new institution for living-working collective in the countryside, Rural Agency exploits the potential of C2C e-commerce, advocates individual entrepreneurship, emphasizes the benefits of collective, challenges the preconceived division between private and public, spatializes residential and community programs for social structure’s soundness, invents economical and sustainable construction system, aggregates individual families into a collective “commune”, and finally seeks a new morphology as the architectural manifestation and catalyst for all of the above.<br></br>
