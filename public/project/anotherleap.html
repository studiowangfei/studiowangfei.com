             As an exhibition unit of the 10th Shanghai Biennale, Another Leap was designed and curated as a cultural event to trigger the tiny, massive and bottom-up power from online and offline crowd. It captured nearly one million visitors in four months and was reported by over twenty media agencies. The manifesto of Another Leap was printed over fouty thousand copies and out of stock in first two weeks of the show.

              Compared to <span class="al_bold" id="manifesto_2">"Great Leap Forward"</span> implemented by the Communist Party of China in 1958, and <span class="al_bold" id="manifesto_3">"one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind"</span> by Neil Armstrong in 1969, Another Leap is a tiny, massive, and bottom-up one. It is a series of collective actions based on individual will. It is a direct practice of <span class="al_bold" id="manifesto_4">"Two heads are better than one"</span>, an empirical iteration of <span class="al_bold" id="manifesto_5">"1+1>2"</span>.
