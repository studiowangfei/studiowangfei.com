            This was the second-phase of the design project for Taobao.com and Alibaba.
            <p>I worked as the designer and data visualizer on this project.
            I collaborated with PM, data and software development engineers to build data-analytics tools for Taobao store oweners to power their online e-commerce business.
            All research documentation, data-based maps, interactives and other visual assets (except photos) were designed, coded and created by me. Only a part of the design is presented here due to NDA.
            <br></br>
            <p style="font-weight: 500">The design (public) was presented to 370M+ Taobao users and the data tool (internal) was delivered to 5M+ Taobao e-commerce store-owners. The design was showcased in 2014 Taobao E-commerce Conference as well as 2014-2015 Shanghai Biennale.

            Design Challenge
          </div>
          <div class="feature_descript">
            This project was designed based on transaction data of Alibaba's Taobao.com (one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world with over 6 million online store owners) during 2013.11.11 E-commerce Fest. The focus was to find out the transaction pattern across mainland China and the connections between city buyers and village sellers. Main design challenges include:
            <br></br>
            <p class="feature_text_list">1. Explore the e-commerce villages which have contributed to the major transactions
            <p class="feature_text_list">2. Use the data to connect the villages and cities
            <p class="feature_text_list">3. Design data viz tools for Taobao store oweners to optimize their logistics

            Connecting cities and villages.
            <br>Transactions mapped.</br>
          </div>
          <div class="feature_descript">
            The map visualized all Taobao shipments from top five e-commerce villages during 2013.11.11 E-commerce Fest. Seller villages are marked as blue circles while buyer cities as grey, the size of transaction (the number of parcels in total) was measured by the area of each circle. Different colors represents different villages' transactions, and the linewidth represents the size of that single transaction.

            By 2014, one in five Taobao sellers are living in China's rural areas and there are over 200 Taobao villages across China.
